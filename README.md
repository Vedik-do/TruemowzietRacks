# MowziesTracksCompat (Forge 1.20.1)

What it does:
- Detects Mowzie's Mobs bosses near the player (Ferrous Wroughtnaut, Umvuthi, Frostmaw, Tongbi).
- While a boss is near, it force-stops background music (including OverhauledMusic if installed) and loops the matching boss track.

This is a CLIENT-ONLY mod.
